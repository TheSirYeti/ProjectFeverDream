Copyright Â©2019-22 GurBu Technologies
---------------------------------
Thank you for supporting GPU Instancer!

---------------------------------
DOCUMENTATION
---------------------------------
Please read our online documentation for more in-depth explanations and customization options at:
https://wiki.gurbu.com/

---------------------------------
SETUP
---------------------------------
Please make sure that you have imported the latest version of GPU Instancer asset to your project first.
If you import GPU Instancer after you imported Crowd Animations, please reimport the GPUInstancer-CrowdAnimations folder.

1. Add Crowd Manager to your scene
Tools -> GPU Instancer -> Add Crowd Manager

2. In the Inspector window, press the "?" button at the top-right corner to get detailed information about setting up the manager.
Or press the "Wiki" button to read more about the Crowd Manager.

Unity Forum Thread: https://forum.unity.com/threads/gpu-instancer-crowd-animations.669724/

---------------------------------
MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS
---------------------------------
- DirectX 11 or DirectX 12 and Shader Model 5.0 GPU (Windows, Windows Store)
